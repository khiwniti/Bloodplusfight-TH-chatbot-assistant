A LINE chatbot that provides product information and uses AI to enhance user experience. Built with Node.js, Express, and in-memory data storage. Integrates with OpenRouter API using the deepseek-r1-0528 model for intelligent responses.

## Features

- Integration with LINE Messaging API
- Simple in-memory product and customer data storage
- Product catalog browsing
- AI-powered responses via OpenRouter and deepseek-r1-0528 model
- Simple Q&A functionality
- Multilingual support (English and Thai)
- HIV/STDs healthcare information

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- LINE Developer Account with a configured channel
- ngrok (installed globally for exposing your local server)
- OpenRouter API key (already configured in the app)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd line-oa-chatbot
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Install ngrok globally**

```bash
npm install -g ngrok
```

4. **Create a .env file**

Create a file named `.env` in the root directory with the following content:

```
# Line Bot Configuration
CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN=YOUR_LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN
CHANNEL_SECRET=YOUR_LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET

# Server Configuration
PORT=3000

# OpenRouter API Configuration (pre-configured)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=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
OPENROUTER_MODEL=deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528:free

# Research Feature Configuration
ENABLE_RESEARCH=true
RESEARCH_MAX_RESULTS=3
RESEARCH_DEFAULT_LANG=en
RESEARCH_TIMEOUT=5000
AUTO_RESEARCH=true
```

5. **Get LINE Credentials**

- Go to the [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/)
- Create a new provider and channel (Messaging API)
- Get your Channel Secret and Channel Access Token
- Add them to your `.env` file

## Running the Application

1. **Start the server in development mode**

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the server with nodemon, which automatically restarts when code changes.

2. **In a separate terminal, start ngrok**

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

3. **Configure LINE Webhook**

When ngrok starts, it will display a public URL. Use this URL to set up your webhook in the LINE Developer Console:

1. Copy the HTTPS URL that appears in the ngrok console (e.g. `https://xxxx-xxx-xxx-xxx.ngrok.io`)
2. Go to your LINE channel in the [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/)
3. In the "Messaging API" tab, scroll to "Webhook settings"
4. Paste the URL and add `/webhook` at the end (e.g. `https://xxxx-xxx-xxx-xxx.ngrok.io/webhook`)
5. Click "Update"
6. Enable the webhook by turning on "Use webhook"

## Available Commands

- `help` - Show available commands
- `hi` or `hello` - Get a greeting
- `products` or `catalog` - View available products
- `history` or `purchases` - View purchase history
- `research [query]` or `‡∏Ñ‡πâ‡∏ô‡∏Ñ‡∏ß‡πâ‡∏≤ [query]` - Search for healthcare information

You can also ask any question, and the chatbot will use the OpenRouter API with the deepseek-r1-0528 model to generate intelligent responses about the products.

## Healthcare Research Feature

The bot can search the web for healthcare information to answer medical queries. This provides up-to-date healthcare information beyond what's hardcoded in the bot.

### How It Works:

1. **Medical Research**: Users can type `research [query]` or `‡∏Ñ‡πâ‡∏ô‡∏Ñ‡∏ß‡πâ‡∏≤ [query]` to request healthcare information on specific medical topics.

2. **Trusted Sources**: The bot prioritizes information from reputable healthcare sources like WHO, CDC, NIH, Mayo Clinic, and other medical institutions.

3. **Medical Disclaimer**: All healthcare information includes a disclaimer to consult healthcare professionals for medical advice.

### Configuration:

Edit the following variables in your `.env` file to customize the research feature:

- `ENABLE_RESEARCH` - Set to "true" to enable the healthcare research capability (default: true)
- `RESEARCH_MAX_RESULTS` - Maximum number of search results to return (default: 3)
- `RESEARCH_DEFAULT_LANG` - Default language for searches when not detected (default: en)
- `RESEARCH_TIMEOUT` - Timeout in milliseconds for search requests (default: 5000)
- `AUTO_RESEARCH` - Set to "true" to automatically enhance AI responses with research (default: true)

## Troubleshooting

### ngrok Issues

If you encounter issues with ngrok:

1. Make sure you've installed ngrok globally: `npm install -g ngrok`
2. Ensure no other ngrok processes are running
3. If you need to authenticate ngrok: `ngrok authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN`
4. Try running on a different port if 3000 is already in use
